# NitroSniper
This project is pretty-old, and so, not representative of my average C# project quality / cleanness.
I simply edited basic stuff for it to be easier to read, but nothing special performance-wise.

It usually takes 300ms to test a nitro, which can be improved by using another discord api wrapper than Anarchy, or simply making your own.

Do what-ever you want with it, re-post it, paste it, re-sell it.
